## SMS HowTo
http://network.epfl.ch/epnet/sms_mgmt.pl, also check the [SWITCH website](http://www.switch.ch/fr/mail/gw-spec.html).

## Ideas

Reflexion about usage
 - want to know if a web site is up
 - want to know if a web site is down
 - want to monitor a list of web site
 - want to receive mail and / or sms on alert
 - want to choose the interval of the check
 - and want to do that in a MEAN interface with tequila passport :)

Nice to have
 - different interval check in function of website
 - incremental alert (e.g. when website is up, no more alert, or only mail alert)
 - number of check to do
